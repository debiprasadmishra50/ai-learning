### Additional Concepts

#### Turing Test

- Proposed by Alan Turing, this test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. If a human evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine apart from a human, the machine is said to have passed the test.

#### LLM (Large Language Model)

- LLMs are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. Examples include GPT-3, GPT-4, and similar models.

#### AI (Artificial Intelligence)

- AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and understanding language.

#### Embeddings

- Embeddings are numerical vector representations of words, sentences, or other data. They capture semantic meaning and relationships, allowing AI models to process and compare complex information efficiently.

#### Tokens

- Tokens are the basic units of text (such as words or subwords) that language models process. Text is broken down into tokens before being fed into an LLM for analysis or generation.
